CNN classifier for boycotted products
In this project, I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for differentiating brands and objects in images. Using TensorFlow and Keras, I trained the model on a comprehensive dataset and achieved high accuracy in classification tasks. I also implemented a real-time classification interface with Streamlit, allowing users to upload images and receive instant feedback on brand and object identification. This project showcases practical applications of CNNs in real-world scenarios.
* the project is in the loader-dataset branch
